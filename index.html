                The Golden Retriever is a large-sized gun dog that retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland
                game birds, during hunting and shooting parties. They were named 'retriever' because of their
                ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth.

                The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of
                gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears,
                and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark.
